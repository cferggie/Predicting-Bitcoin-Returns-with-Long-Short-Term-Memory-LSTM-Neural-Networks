Abstract – Forecasting time series data is a topic of ongoing interest in finance and economics. Traditional ways of forecasting time series data include methods such as Autoregressive Models (AR), Moving Average Models (MA), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models (ARIMA). With improvements in technology, the methods used for forecasting time series data have expanded and now include deep learning algorithms. Deep learning comprises a variety of neural network architectures, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks being a popular type of recurrent neural network that excels at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. This study aims to answer the question of whether the deep learning methods of forecasting, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks, outperform older, more traditional ways such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models. The results from this paper indicate that ARIMA models outperform LSTM models when applied to Bitcoin Price with out-of-sample RMSE values of equivalently 550.6532 and 590.5733, respectively.
